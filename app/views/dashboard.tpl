<h1>ACO Wrangler Credentialing</h1>
<p>	
Welcome to the best (only??) Open Source Healthcare Credentialing system. Everything you need to manage the credentialing process should be here or will be soon. The process works like this:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>First you need to completely model you doctor, practice and all of the relationships using the "Data" tab</li>
	<li>Once you have done this, you can generate your Texas credentialing form under "Doctors"</li>
	<li>We have a document generation pipeline that includes a versioning database, so you can track "versions" of a doctors credentialing document</li>
	<li>Once you have generated the credentialing form, then it is just one pdf that you can track, with expiration dates in the document management system</li>
	<li>Every document, and many other data points in the system "expire", you can see a list by clicking the "Expiring" tab</li>
	<li>At any time you can see reports about important stuff in your database. See the <a href='https://github.com/ftrotter/Credential'>github documentation</a> on how to make new reports.</li>
	<li>These are all available under the "Reports" tab and are all downloadable to spreadsheet at any time</li>

	
<ol>
