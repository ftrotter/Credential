This file tracks the progress of automatic SQL to JSON form compiling
Create a new SQL file that ends in "json.sql" and has a trailing WHERE Providers.id = 
so that when we add $npi to it will limit it to the current provider...
In general, only one row should be returned by these queries...
unless there are potentially multiples.. .like "Practice" in which case the rows compile to practice_0 and practice_1 etc etc...

It will not be worth recording some things here...
