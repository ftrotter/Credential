educationcodes -> EducationLevels is manually migrated 
ethniccodes -> Ethniccodes is manually migrated
exportbatches not migrated
exportrecords not migrated
facilities data is empty on the old data set... not migrating...
hospital migration requires a script...

	-> Address
       -> Phone
run hospital_migration.php
languagecodes -> Languages is manually migrated
licensecodes -> Licensecodes is manually migrated
medicalboard migration requires a script

provider -> new script to pull out addresses, but keep the ids
provider agents -> the agent id does not link to anything
providercarrier-> manual migration
providerfiles-> its empty and it goes away in favor of the new documents section...
providermedicaids -> its empty and we have no idea what it is for. It goes away.
providercertificates is a mess 
		instead move to a system that has ids that expire at particular times...
providercredentials is the core table that organizes who is credentialing for who and when it has to happen again...
	but because the relationship is also embeded in the practice... we will not do an import...
	But this is how we will track the expiration of the whole credential process...


The things below here are NOTDONE and my not be doable.. May require manual migration...


providerpractices is another nightmare.. it is so incredibly backwards		
	It is patently, frustratingly obvious that provide practice needs to be many to many with providers...
	Not sure how much more obvious this could be.. design decisions like this 
	(done) Need new object Billing Company... 
	(done)Billing company has address, phone, fax
	(done)CredentialOrganization needs to be expanded
	practice_0_total_num and practice_0_current_num should be calculated by the generator...
	(done)has a fax
	(done)has an address
	(done)has a phone

	


providereducations has no links to specialty codes
		It needs to create education institutions...
		with addresses
		
providerhospitals is not normalized.. what is the point of having a seperate hospital table...

providerinsurance needs to be split into a seperate insurance company file...
		then have a normalized relationship with that...
		that "normalized relationship should include the amounts and the policy numbers.."
		we already have ProviderCarriers which is half implementation of this...
		It needs to be ported or abandoned in favor of the Insurancecoverage notions..

		
providerlicense code needs to move to using state id... 
		have to write code...


providerspecialties needs to be migrated with code
		because this fucking database was normalized by a sadist or a moron. Maybe both. 

providernetworks needs to be coded

providernotes needs to be coded

I have no idea why there is a providereducation to providereducation table...
Also ProvidersProviderSpecialitys is a mystery too...
What??!!??@

I can autogenerate many_to_many relationships by marking the tables that are Many_to_Many 
using an underscore in the name. So Provider_Specialitys instead of ProviderSpecialtys

Using the new polymorphic models in Laravel 4, I might be able to auto generate
Tags and Notes.. which can attach to any thing...
Then I can add notes and tags on the object list page... 
And I can expire notes... and add them to the expiring list....









Primary care status is all over the place.

TODO why are the provider drop downs in Identifier not working??

ALTER TABLE `Ethniccodes`  
ADD `created_by_User_id` INT(11) NOT NULL,  ADD `modified_by_User_id` INT(11) NOT NULL,  ADD `created_at` DATETIME NOT NULL,  ADD `updated_at` DATETIME NOT NULL
